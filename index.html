      <p>Hi! I'm Eliza Brock. Or, at least I was! I'm married now and about 15 years older than I was when the information on this website was last current.</p>
      <p>This site is a sample portfolio project that I'm making to show my students (Sophmore CS majors) how to make their own portfolio websites and how to give them some pizzaz and personality. You can check out the Portfolio page to see how this project progresses from simple semantic markup into a completed portfolio website.</p>
      <p>If this was my actual website, I'd definitely put more information about me here. The about page is a great opportunity to show readers that you're a real person that they should get to know better, and not some unfeeling robot!</p>
